If the project won't compile using Visual Studio, try this:
1. Include "winmm.lib" under Additional Dependencies
2. Change Subsystem to "Windows" rather than "Console"

Move with WASD or the arrow keys on your keyboard. Pause with P, fullscreen with F, 
and close the game with Escape. That's about it, for now.
